%BinaryUnkownDistTest if a sample data set is more like one of two possible
%reference datasets.
%   Tests if it is more likely that the sample came from the same
%   distribution as reference sample 0 or 1. This is accomplished by
%   performing a likelihood ratio test of the t-statistic for two unpaired
%   samples of unequal sample size and variance between the ref0-sample and
%   ref1-sample. Assumes a prior probabilities p(dist. 0)=p(dist. 1)=1/2
%   unless otherwise specified.
%   
% Inputs:
%   ref0: vector array of values for sample known to come from dist. 0. Must
%         have >1 observation.
%   ref1: vector array of values for sample known to come from dist. 1. Must
%         have >1 observation.
%   sample: vector array of values from sample to test. Must have >1
%           observation.
%
% Outputs:
%   decision: Boolean whether sample is closer to reference sample 0 or 1.
%   lambda: likelihood ratio.
%   estimate: re-scaled likelihood ratio to give metric between 0 and 1.
